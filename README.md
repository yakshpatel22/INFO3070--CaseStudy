# INFO3070--CaseStudy
A client/server application that is designed and deployed in layers. Projects incorporate JavaScript and jQuery clients making REST calls to an ASP.Net Core server. C# is used server-side in conjunction with the Entity Framework, LINQ, and a SQL Server database. This server database is dedicated to employee management. It's populated with hardcoded SQL data imported into the database. The application offers a range of interconnected menu options, each serving a specific purpose. These options include:

1. Home Page: The home page provides an overview of the application, displaying its icon and offering a brief introduction to its purpose.
2. Employee Page: This section allows users to access and manipulate employee data stored in the system. Users can add, update, delete, and edit employee information, including the ability to change employee images, which are saved in the database. The database is dynamically updated or deleted when the user clicks the corresponding buttons.
3. Calls: In this section, users can access 1,100 predefined data entries. Each entry includes information such as the date, problem description, and the associated employee. The page also features a search bar on the right side, enabling users to filter and search for specific data based on the selected criteria.

This project represents an individual endeavor, completed over a span of four months during the semester. It underscores my proficiency in database management, user interface design, and the development of a comprehensive application for employee and call data management."
